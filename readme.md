### RSS Backend
This project is created for fun and to practice Golang. It serves as an opportunity to delve into Golang development by building a project from start to finish.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to deepen my understanding of Golang. Inspired by a YouTube video on freecodecamp by [Lane Wagner](https://github.com/wagslane), I decided to create a similar kind of project. Having learned Golang from Boot.Dev, I aimed to implement additional functionality beyond the original project.

### Note
    This marks my inaugural project in Golang.
    Expect more Golang projects in the future!
